<p>Eligibility for admission to the University is described at Sacramento State Admissions; registration dates and fees can be found at General Registration Information.

Students must apply online.  If you are an international student, please visit: Office of Global Education.

Once accepted, new undergraduate (freshman and transfer) students attend the mandatory campus orientation session. Major advising is provided as part of the orientation sessions. For information about transferable courses, see www.assist.org.  If you took a course at an institution that does not have a transfer agreement with Sacramento State, contact the Associate Chair, Dr. Scott Gordon.

Please note that ALL new students, freshmen or transfer students, are admitted as Pre-Computer Science students and cannot register for restricted upper-division courses (CSC 133 and above) until they complete all requirements to change their major to Computer Science.

Information about financial aid can be found at the Financial Aid website. Please note that financial aid is generally not available for international students.</p>
