<!-- Pharagraph-- Talk a little bit about the Computer Science Program -->
<p>Computer science touches almost all aspects of our daily lives. It is the basis of many of the endeavors in society today and continues to advance various areas and open new fields, among them the entertainment industry, engineering, government, medicine, manufacturing, science, space exploration and communication. From its theoretical and algorithmic foundations to cutting-edge developments in robotics, computer vision, intelligent systems, bioinformatics and other exciting areas, a comprehensive foundation in computer science allows graduates to adapt to new technologies and new ideas.

Career possibilities abound for our graduates. The fast pace of technology has created many new and exciting jobs in computing, including computer graphics specialist, computer systems analyst, data communications analyst, database administrator, programmer analyst, software engineer, systems engineer, systems programmer, information assurance specialist, and network security engineer. Major employers of recent graduates are among the most prominent of US corporations and research laboratories, including Accenture, Apple, Chevron, Google, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, NASA, Northrop Grumman, PG&E, SMUD, VSP, Yahoo, State of California and the Federal Goverment, to name a few.

Sacramento State's Computer Science Department is one of the oldest and largest computer science programs in the CSU system. Our baccalaureate and masters programs have educated computer professionals since 1969. Currently our programs serve approximately 900+ majors. In addition, the Department offers a variety of service courses to non-majors who seek practical experience in the application of information technology.

The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org/. The B.S. program provides majors with a sound educational base. The Master of Science prepares students for research, teaching, or further study towards the Ph.D. in Computer Science or Software Engineering. (Currently the Ph.D. is offered by the University of California in various locations and some private institutions such as Stanford University.) Our programs also enable individuals with background in other areas to obtain the skills and knowledge necessary to enter and/or advance in employment in computer-related industries.

The Department offers the Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Computer Engineering in conjunction with the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department.</p>
